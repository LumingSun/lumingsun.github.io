Despite decades of efforts from both research and industrial communities, query optimization remains one of the most challenging problems. Thanks to the advances in artificial intelligence, data-driven and learning-based techniques are seeing traction in database research recently. However, most former learning-based works perform less practical because they are evasive about the interaction between learning components and database systems. In this demonstration,we introduce DeepO, a novel deep-learningbased query optimizer that offers high-quality and fine-grained query optimization efficiently and practically.We implement DeepO and incorporate it into PostgreSQL, and we also provide a web user interface, where users can carry out the optimization operations interactively and evaluate the optimization performance. Preliminary results show that DeepO outperforms the baseline PostgreSQL optimizer.","tags":[],"title":"DeepO: A Learned Query Optimizer","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Every query is usually only related to the table’s some attributes in the database, so only a subset of the table’s attributes can be used to get the accurate query results. Reasonable vertical data partitioning can make most queries answered without scanning the whole table, so as to reduce the amount of data accessing and improve the efficiency of query processing. Traditional database vertical partitioning methods are mainly based on heuristic rules set by experts. The granularity of partitioning is coarse, and it can not provide different partition optimizations according to the characteristics of workload. Besides, when the scale of workload or the number of attributes becomes large, the execution time of the existing methods are too long and especially can not meet the performance requirements of online real-time tuning of database. Therefore, we propose a method called Spectral Clustering based Vertical Partitioning (SCVP) for the online environment. We adapt the idea of phased solution to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm and speed up partitioning. Firstly, SCVP reduces the solution space by increasing the constraint conditions, that is, generating initial partitions by spectral clustering. Secondly, SCVP designs the algoithum to search solution space, that is, the initial partitions are optimized by combining frequent itemset mining and greedy search. In order to further improve the performance of SCVP under high-dimensional attributes, we propose a new method called Special Clustering based Vertical Partitioning Redesign (SCVP-R) which is an improved version of SCVP. SCVP-R optimizes the partitions combiner component of SCVP by introducing sympatric-competition mechanism, double-elimination mechanism, and loop mechanism. The experimental results on different datasets show that SCVP and SCVP-R have faster execution time and better performance than the current state-of-the-art vertical partitioning method.","tags":[],"title":"SCVP:Multi-stage Method for Online Vertical Data Partitioning Based on Spectral Clustering (In Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luming Sun","Cuiping Li","Tao Ji","Hong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Traditional estimators such as histograms make several assumptions during estimation that can lead to huge errors. Recently the database community started exploring the usage of machine learning in selectivity estimation and won great achievements. However, due to the black box models they used, existing learning-based methods still face several new challenges, including high estimation latency, large training data demanding, and occurrence of illogical results. In this work, we propose a learning-based MOnotonic Selectivity Estimator (MOSE) to address these challenges. We first learn a multi-dimensional cumulative distribution function of the data in a supervised method and then compute selectivity for ad hoc query predicates at rum-time. We propose a novel regularizer and an effective attribute-aware calibration method to improve the estimation accuracy. To further improve the model efficiency, we design a mutual information based model ensemble method. With regard to the heavy cost of training data collection, we design a model-based active learning strategy to generate high-quality training data cost-effectively. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets and the results show that MOSE outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.","tags":[],"title":"MOSE: A Monotonic Selectivity Estimator Using Learned CDF","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huan Liu","Pengju Liu","Tianyi Wang","Yuqi He","Luming Sun","Cuiping Li","Hong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

How to quickly and efficiently extract the information for analysis and decision-making from these massive data brings great challenges to the database system, At the same time, the real-time performance of analysis data in modern business analysis and decision-making requires that the database system can process ACID transactions and complex analysis queries. However, the traditional data partition granularity is too coarse, and can not adapt to the dynamic changes of complex analysis load; the traditional data layout is single, and can not cope with the modern increasing mixed transaction analysis application scenarios In order to solve the above problems, \"intelligent data partition and layout\" has become one of the current research hotspots. It extracts the effective characteristics of workload through data mining, machine learning and other technologies, and design appropriate partition strategy to avoid scanning a large number of irrelevant data and guide the layout structure design to adapt to different types of workloads.

Cloud providers estimate storage usages based on the forecast and allocate resources accordingly. Overestimated space usages require a redundant storage buffer that brings unnecessary cost, and underestimated space usages will cause capacity shortages that may lead to data loss and Service-Level Agreement (SLA) failures. While accurate storage forecasting is important, it is highly challenging due to various storage usage patterns on different workloads and storage systems. Moreover, some operations from users or administrators may cause transient workload burst in historical data, which makes forecasting even harder. In this paper, we propose the Storage Usage Forecasting Service (SUFS) that combines deep neural networks and statistical models adaptively to make predictions for multiple major storage systems in ByteDance. SUFS carries comprehensive analyses of storage usage time series from various storage systems in real business scenarios. To handle workload bursts in historical data, we enhance regular LSTMs using a control signal that is installed on the input gate. When the burst is detected, the control signal reduces the input influences to the cell state. To further improve the prediction accuracy, SUFS integrates the Enhanced-LSTM (ELSTM) with a novel adaptive ensemble method. Different from previous works, our approach learns dynamic ensemble weights for each prediction step on-the-fly, making our model more accurate for multiple-step predictions. SUFS has been deployed to serve more than 150,000 storage instances. We conducted extensive experiments on the storage systems that are widely-used in ByteDance, and the results show that SUFS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and significantly reduces storage cost.","tags":[],"title":"SUFS: A Generic Storage Usage Forecasting Service Through Adaptive Ensemble Learning","type":"publication"}]
