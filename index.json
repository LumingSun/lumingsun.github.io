However, the widespread adoption of learned indexes is limited by their expensive training cost and the need for high accuracy of internal models. Although some studies attempt to optimize the building process of these learned indexes, existing methods are restrictive in scope and applicability. They are usually tailored to specific index types and heavily rely on pre-trained model knowledge, making deployment a challenging task. In this work, we introduce the Learned Index Optimization Framework (LIOF), a general and easily integrated solution aimed at expediting the training process and improving the accuracy of index model for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional learned indexes. The optimization of LIOF for the learned indexes is intuitive, directly providing optimized parameters for index models based on the distribution of node data. By leveraging the correlation between key distribution and node model parameters, LIOF significantly reduces the training epochs required for each node model. Initially, we introduce an optimization strategy inspired by optimization-based meta-learning to train the LIOF to generate optimized initial parameters for index node models. Subsequently, we present a data-driven encoder and a parameter-centric decoder network, which adaptively translate key distribution into a latent variable representation and decode it into optimized node model initialization. Additionally, to further utilize characteristics of key distribution, we propose a monotonic regularizer and focal loss, guiding LIOF training towards efficiency and precision. Through extensive experimentation on real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that LIOF provides substantial enhancements in both training efficiency and the predictive accuracy for learned indexes.","tags":[],"title":"LIOF: Make the Learned Index Learn Faster With Higher Accuracy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiyan Li","Haoyang Li","Zhao Pu","Jing Zhang","Xinyi Zhang","Tao Ji","Luming Sun","Cuiping L","Hong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

However, traditional tuning methods often follow a Try-Collect-Adjust approach, proving inefficient and database-specific. Moreover, these methods are often opaque, making it challenging for DBAs to grasp the underlying decision-making process. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Claude-3 has excelled in complex natural language tasks, yet their potential in database knob tuning remains largely unexplored. This study harnesses LLMs as experienced DBAs for knob-tuning tasks with carefully designed prompts. We identify three key subtasks in the tuning system, knob pruning, model initialization, and knob recommendation, proposing LLM-driven solutions to replace conventional methods for each subtask. We conduct extensive experiments to compare LLM-driven approaches against traditional methods across the subtasks to evaluate LLMs' efficacy in the knob tuning domain. Furthermore, we explore the adaptability of LLM-based solutions in diverse evaluation settings, encompassing new benchmarks, database engines, and hardware environments. Our findings reveal that LLMs not only match or surpass traditional methods but also exhibit notable interpretability by generating responses in a coherent ``chain-of-thought'' manner. We further observe that LLMs exhibit remarkable generalizability through simple adjustments in prompts, eliminating the necessity for additional training or extensive code modifications. Drawing insights from our experimental findings, we identify several opportunities for future research aimed at advancing the utilization of LLMs in the realm of database management.","tags":[],"title":"Is Large Language Model Good at Database Knob Tuning?

They either learn to construct plans from scratch in a bottom-up manner or guide the plan generation behavior of traditional optimizer using hints. While these methods have achieved some success, they face challenges in either low training efficiency or limited plan search space. To address these challenges, we introduce FOSS, a novel DRL-based framework for query optimization. FOSS initiates optimization from the original plan generated by a traditional optimizer and incrementally refines suboptimal nodes of the plan through a sequence of actions. Additionally, we devise an asymmetric advantage model to evaluate the advantage between two plans. We integrate it with a traditional optimizer to form a simulated environment. Leveraging this simulated environment, FOSS can bootstrap itself to rapidly generate a large amount of high-quality simulated experiences. FOSS then learns and improves its optimization capability from these simulated experiences. We evaluate the performance of FOSS on Join Order Benchmark, TPC-DS, and Stack Overflow. The experimental results demonstrate that FOSS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of latency performance and optimization time. Compared to PostgreSQL, FOSS achieves savings ranging from 15% to 83% in total latency across different benchmarks.","tags":[],"title":"FOSS: A Self-Learned Doctor for Query Optimizer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xianghong Xu","Zhibing Zhao","Tieying Zhang","Rong Kang","Luming Sun","Jianjun Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Numerous works have introduced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to this field, but few of them are proven practical due to long training time, lack of interpretability, and integration cost. A recent study provides a practical method to optimize queries by recommending per-query hints but it suffers from two inherited problems. First, it follows the regression framework to predict the absolute latency of each query plan, which is very challenging because the latencies of query plans for a certain query may span multiple orders of magnitude. Second, it requires training a model for each dataset, which restricts the application of the trained models in practice. In this paper, we propose COOOL to predict Cost Orders of query plans to cOOperate with DBMS by Learning-To-Rank. Instead of estimating absolute costs, COOOL uses ranking-based approaches to compute relative ranking scores of the costs of query plans. We show that COOOL is theoretically valid to distinguish between better and worse query plans. We implement COOOL on PostgreSQL, and extensive experiments on join-order-benchmark and TPC-H data demonstrate that COOOL outperforms PostgreSQL and state-of-the-art methods on single-dataset tasks as well as a unified model for multiple-dataset tasks. Our experiments also shed some light on why COOOL outperforms regression approaches from the representation learning perspective, which may guide future research.","tags":[],"title":"COOOL: A Learning-To-Rank Approach for SQL Hint Recommendations ","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.

Cloud providers estimate storage usages based on the forecast and allocate resources accordingly. Overestimated space usages require a redundant storage buffer that brings unnecessary cost, and underestimated space usages will cause capacity shortages that may lead to data loss and Service-Level Agreement (SLA) failures. While accurate storage forecasting is important, it is highly challenging due to various storage usage patterns on different workloads and storage systems. Moreover, some operations from users or administrators may cause transient workload burst in historical data, which makes forecasting even harder. In this paper, we propose the Storage Usage Forecasting Service (SUFS) that combines deep neural networks and statistical models adaptively to make predictions for multiple major storage systems in ByteDance. SUFS carries comprehensive analyses of storage usage time series from various storage systems in real business scenarios. To handle workload bursts in historical data, we enhance regular LSTMs using a control signal that is installed on the input gate. When the burst is detected, the control signal reduces the input influences to the cell state. To further improve the prediction accuracy, SUFS integrates the Enhanced-LSTM (ELSTM) with a novel adaptive ensemble method. Different from previous works, our approach learns dynamic ensemble weights for each prediction step on-the-fly, making our model more accurate for multiple-step predictions. SUFS has been deployed to serve more than 150,000 storage instances. We conducted extensive experiments on the storage systems that are widely-used in ByteDance, and the results show that SUFS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and significantly reduces storage cost.","tags":[],"title":"SUFS: A Generic Storage Usage Forecasting Service Through Adaptive Ensemble Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luming Sun","Tao Ji","Cuiping Li","Hong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Every query is usually only related to the table’s some attributes in the database, so only a subset of the table’s attributes can be used to get the accurate query results. Reasonable vertical data partitioning can make most queries answered without scanning the whole table, so as to reduce the amount of data accessing and improve the efficiency of query processing. Traditional database vertical partitioning methods are mainly based on heuristic rules set by experts. The granularity of partitioning is coarse, and it can not provide different partition optimizations according to the characteristics of workload. Besides, when the scale of workload or the number of attributes becomes large, the execution time of the existing methods are too long and especially can not meet the performance requirements of online real-time tuning of database. Therefore, we propose a method called Spectral Clustering based Vertical Partitioning (SCVP) for the online environment. We adapt the idea of phased solution to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm and speed up partitioning. Firstly, SCVP reduces the solution space by increasing the constraint conditions, that is, generating initial partitions by spectral clustering. Secondly, SCVP designs the algoithum to search solution space, that is, the initial partitions are optimized by combining frequent itemset mining and greedy search. In order to further improve the performance of SCVP under high-dimensional attributes, we propose a new method called Special Clustering based Vertical Partitioning Redesign (SCVP-R) which is an improved version of SCVP. SCVP-R optimizes the partitions combiner component of SCVP by introducing sympatric-competition mechanism, double-elimination mechanism, and loop mechanism. The experimental results on different datasets show that SCVP and SCVP-R have faster execution time and better performance than the current state-of-the-art vertical partitioning method.","tags":[],"title":"SCVP:Multi-stage Method for Online Vertical Data Partitioning Based on Spectral Clustering (In Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Luming Sun","Cuiping Li","Tao Ji","Hong Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The development of artificial intelligence provides a brand-new opportunity for database management systems with its power in learning, reasoning, and planning. Through learning from data distribution, query workload and query execution performance, the systems powered by artificial intelligence are able to forecast future workload, tune database configurations, partition data blocks, index on proper columns, estimate selectivity, optimize query plan and control query concurrency automatically. Also, some machine learning models can replace core components of a database such as index structures. This study introduces new research on database systems with artificial intelligence and state the existing problems and potential solutions and the future research directions are proposed as well.","tags":[],"title":"Survey of Data Management Techniques Powered by Artificial Intelligence (In Chinese)","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
